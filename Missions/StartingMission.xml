    <subject>Hey.</subject>
    <body>
		Hey there, #PLAYERNAME#. Glad you could come with us earlier today!
		You said you wanted to get into Hacking, network security and stuff so I thought I'd help you through starting.
		We have no real jobs for you so we're gonna let you have a bit of fun.
		
		We have a Raspberry pi with some starter tools. I'll send you the IP to that, and I'll let you loose. Message me back when you have SSHCrack.exe
